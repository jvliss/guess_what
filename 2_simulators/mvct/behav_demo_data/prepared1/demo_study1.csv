161,guess,1,9,I saw that there was 16 numbers every round. So I saw if the numbers below 500 or above 500 were about 9. I looked at the first number in the sequence to find this. For me I always counted the numbers above 500 to see if they were about 9 or not.,yes,100.0,16,1,4,high numbers,3.0,To use the information in the numbers without actually adding them all together to get the average.,right-handed,,Maybe explain the part when you meant at first glance a bit more.,26,English,Cis male,1,9.61666666666667,111.466666666667
162,control,0,2,"to be perfectly frank, originally ""during the testing stages"" I was writing down a list 1-9 ( each symbolising their respective set of 100, for example 100,200,300 ect)) so each number if it was 300, then Id put a tally mark infront of 3. after I tallied up all the numbers, if more were under 500 vs over 500 then i knew within a small margin the likely hood was less than 500. Then of course if I had 6 tallies in the 1-2 area, and 6 numbers in the 5-6 range.. I knew for 100% the median was under 500 just from the difference.

Once the Testing phase began I had to switch up my strategy entirely. upon learning I had 4 sets of 100 to complete, if I wanted to complete the test phase in any reasonable amount of time I had to come up with a strategy that allowed for an educated guess within a few seconds. So my strategy became at first glace, are there more numbers greater than 500 or less than 500? Using that to make the most educated guess of an answer. I'd also look for outlier clusters as well, If I saw 4+ 800 numbers and 5-6 500-600 range I could know that, atleast the mean of those numbers would be greater than 500. So then I could look at what was left to effect the mean and make my best guess accordingly. 

One thing that I was a bit confused about was the test put emphasis and us ( the test takers) making certain of our answer before proceeding each round... Yet the pay/ alloted time for this task doesn't allow for anything more than a few seconds per round. So Im curious if the intention was to have us come up with a strategy similar to my own? Or if it was to really have us put in the time and effort to legitimatly fine the correct answer for all 400 sets? Even if put in the time and effort to do that, I'd have to double check but I wouldnt be surprised if we ran out of time... Nothing is a greater slap in the face than putting in extra time and effort to go above and beyond for a task, only to run out of time and lose out on the already way less than fair amount of pay for the task at hand.

Anyway, I digress, hopefully yall can take something away from this to improve your future tasks. 

Thanks for the opportunity!
