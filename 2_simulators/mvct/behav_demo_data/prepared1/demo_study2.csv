89,control,5,8,"A strategy I used was paying attention to what the first number of a three digit number was and looking around to see how often or how little that number showed up. This allowed me to quickly make a decision whether it was less than 500 or more than 500. For example, if I saw a lot of 1s or 2s among the three digit numbers, I could tell it was less than 500.
